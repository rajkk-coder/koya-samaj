      <p>As table salt is most often produced by distillation of seawater, it is difficult to avoid microplastics in the final products without additional purification steps since seawater contains microplastics [2,28]. Usually, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was used to digest organic matter in the solution after dissolving sea salts[14,15,29,30]. Typically, sodium iodide (NaI) was used for density separation up to 1.8 g cm*3 of solution density[30,31]
When microplastics were counted visually under a dissection microscope with or without staining (e.g., Rose Bengal) [32], the resulting concentrations were usually higher than those measured under a microscope and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), indicating a potential false-positive count. Large pore sizes (149 μm) resulted in significantly lower microplastic concentrations in both sea salts and lake salts[31]. Due to the experimental size cutoff at a lower range (0.2–11 μm), no significant differences in microplastic concentrations were found. Microplastics less than 10 μm would be very difficult to detect using stereo microscopes coupled with FT-IR spectroscopy[37]. Although rock salts and lake salts contained more fibers than sea salts, their microplastic levels were not significantly different from those of sea salts  [14].
